<p>I was recently tasked with reaching out to people who demoed products on our website and see if there are any genuine leads. The only infomation I had was their email, what product they treid and the country they were from. I realised I have to first reach out to all of them thorugh mail and take it forward when I get a response. With limited information available, I had to use a generic template for the mail content and send a bunch of emails and this needs to be done frequently.</p>
